Lets say N = size of the array. Then, following holds true :
* All elements in the array are in the range [0, N-1]
* N * N does not overflow for a signed integer

    int n = A.size();
    for (int i=0; i < n; i++)
        A[i] += (A[A[i]]%n)*n;
 
    // Second Step: Divide all values by n
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        A[i] /= n;
